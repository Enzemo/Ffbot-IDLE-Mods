Mods for Elbody's Ffbot idle game

May or may not ban you from leaderboards! 

Plays a gameover sfx when ernding (Include a gameover.wav in the same folder as the exe, or take my example one from releases)

Currently generates two Json files with various information in the same location as exe. See releases for pck and example Json output. 

An example html can be found here, this is simply an example of how the Jsons can be used. https://enzemo.github.io/Ffbot-IDLE-Mods/
